gdfs
====

An attempt at making Google Drive storage available as part of the
filesystem in linux.

I started this mainly as a hobby project, but partly because Google say
they're working on an official client, but it's been over a year since
they said that with still no progress.

It's very much a work in progress so I don't recommend anybody attempts
to use it yet, but someday it might be useful :-)
